# Answer Key for the MS Python (CMU) Pre-Assessment

## Accessing the Answer Key

The answer key is contained in 'answers.py,' which is in the root directory of this repo.

## Placement Guide

Use the placement guide as follows: If a student answers all questions through question-XX correctly, find the row of the guide containing question-XX. The second column of this row dictates which curriculum week/lesson the student should start with.

| Question Answered Correctly | Starting Unit |
| --------------------------- | ------------- |
| question-01                 | Unit 2        |
| question-02                 | Unit 2        |
| question-03                 | Unit 3        |
| question-04                 | Unit 3        |
| question-05                 | Unit 4        |
| question-06                 | Unit 5        |
| question-07                 | Unit 5        |
| question-08                 | Unit 7        |
| question-09                 | Unit 8        |
| question-10                 | See below     |

If a student answers all 10 questions correctly, please contact the Director of STEM Programming or the Chief Academic Officer. An alternate plan will need to be created for them, and the adminstrators above will help with that.
